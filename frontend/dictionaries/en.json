			"paragraph1": "Personal assistance is a personal matter, and reaching out to someone whom we know nothing about can be a barrier for some. In the following lines, I will, therefore, try to write something about myself and assistance at mine so that you can get a little idea of what it would mean for you.",
			"paragraph2": "My name is Daniela, or Dani, as people usually call me. I am a Slovak who moved to Prague 21 years ago. If I didn't happen to travel, I spent most of the following years in the Czech Republic, but also in Slovakia and Sweden. As a PhD student at Charles University in the field of social anthropology (interconnected with disability studies and gender studies, which I'm a master of), I have been researching personal assistance from a user's perspective for several years. In my personal life, I am an activist and a woman in an electric wheelchair with a continuous need of personal assistance. Due to a diagnosis that prevents me from strengthening my muscles beyond a minimal level, I cannot, for example, raise my arm, even though at first glance, when sitting, it may seem like there's nothing so serious. I don't have any family who could assist me, which is why I seek help in the form of personal assistance.",
			"paragraph3": "As I need round-the-clock assistance, I have people around me 24 hours a day - they rotate after the number of hours that suits them (approximately 4-6 hours during the day or the whole night). If longer services would suit you, we would have to agree on that and adjust the tasks accordingly (use more lifting equipment, etc.). The principle is that these people have to cover 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Assistance is usually provided at my apartment or outside as needed, in Czech Prague - Hostivař (mostly during the school year) or in the Trebišov district, Slovakia, (mostly during major holidays and summer months).",
